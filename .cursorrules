# LangChain Research Agent - Cursor Rules

## Project Overview
This is an educational LangChain project demonstrating how to build a research agent on Linode with local LLMs. The project progresses through modules 01-06, teaching LangChain concepts step-by-step.

## Code Style & Standards

### Python
- Use Python 3.10+ type hints for all functions
- Follow PEP 8 style guide
- Maximum line length: 100 characters
- Use descriptive variable and function names
- Include docstrings for all functions, classes, and modules

### Educational Focus
- **All code must be educational** - include comments explaining LangChain concepts
- Each file should have a header comment explaining what it teaches
- Use progressive complexity - start simple, build up
- Make concepts explicit rather than implicit

### File Structure
- Modules are numbered: `01_basics`, `02_tools`, etc.
- Each module has a README.md explaining prerequisites and learning objectives
- Code examples should be runnable independently
- Use `__init__.py` files to document module purpose

## LangChain Best Practices

### Prompts
- Always use `PromptTemplate` or `ChatPromptTemplate` (not raw strings)
- Include clear variable names in templates
- Use system prompts for agent instructions
- Document prompt engineering decisions in comments

### Tools
- Create well-documented tool functions
- Include clear descriptions for tool schemas (agents use these!)
- Handle errors gracefully in tools
- Add type hints to tool inputs/outputs

### Agents
- Use appropriate agent types for the task
- Include `max_iterations` to prevent infinite loops
- Add `return_intermediate_steps=True` for debugging/learning
- Use verbose mode in examples to show agent reasoning

### Monitoring
- Always include basic logging/callbacks in examples
- Use `StdOutCallbackHandler` for educational visibility
- Consider LangSmith for advanced monitoring
- Track token usage when using API-based models

## Documentation Standards

### Blog Posts
- Located in `docs/blog/`
- Named: `##-descriptive-name.md`
- Include code examples with explanations
- Reference related source files in `src/`
- Provide step-by-step instructions
- Include troubleshooting sections

### Code Comments
- Explain **why**, not just **what**
- Reference LangChain concepts explicitly
- Include links to relevant documentation
- Comment complex logic and non-obvious decisions

### README Files
- Each module needs a README.md
- Include prerequisites, learning objectives, and usage examples
- Link to related blog posts
- Provide troubleshooting guidance

## Development Workflow

### Module Progression
1. Start with `01_basics` and work sequentially through `06_complete`
2. Each module builds on previous concepts
3. Test code as you build it
4. Write corresponding blog post after code is working

### Testing
- Write tests alongside code (in `tests/` directory)
- Test individual components before integration
- Use example data from `examples/` directory
- Verify both local and remote model paths work

### Code Examples
- Make examples self-contained and runnable
- Include error handling for common issues
- Use environment variables for configuration
- Provide both simple and complete examples

## File Organization

### Source Code (`src/`)
- `01_basics/` - Fundamental concepts (prompts, chains, local LLM)
- `02_tools/` - Creating and using tools
- `03_agents/` - Building agents
- `04_data/` - Loading CSV and markdown data
- `05_monitoring/` - Callbacks and LangSmith
- `06_complete/` - Full research agent
- `utils/` - Shared utilities (models, database, monitoring)

### Documentation (`docs/`)
- `blog/` - Blog post series (written as modules are built)
- Each blog post corresponds to module progression

### Examples (`examples/`)
- `companies/` - Sample CSV files for testing
- `instructions/` - Sample markdown instruction files

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
- Use `.env` file for configuration (see `config/env.example`)
- Never commit `.env` file
- Document all required environment variables
- Provide sensible defaults where possible

### Model Support
- Support both local (LlamaCpp) and remote (OpenAI, Anthropic) models
- Use abstraction layer in `src/utils/models.py`
- Make model switching easy via configuration
- Handle model loading errors gracefully

## Key Principles

1. **Educational First**: Every piece of code should teach something
2. **Progressive Learning**: Build complexity gradually
3. **Working Examples**: All code should be functional and testable
4. **Clear Documentation**: Explain concepts, not just syntax
5. **Best Practices**: Show how to do things right, not just how they work

## Common Patterns

### Model Loading
```python
# Use abstraction from utils
from src.utils.models import get_llm

llm = get_llm(model_type="local", model_path="./models/llama.gguf")
```

### Prompt Templates
```python
from langchain_core.prompts import PromptTemplate

template = "Research information about {company_name}"
prompt = PromptTemplate(template=template, input_variables=["company_name"])
```

### Agent Creation
```python
from langchain.agents import AgentExecutor, create_react_agent

agent = create_react_agent(llm=llm, tools=tools, prompt=prompt)
agent_executor = AgentExecutor(
    agent=agent,
    tools=tools,
    verbose=True,
    max_iterations=10
)
```

## When Writing Code

- Always import from `langchain_core` for base components
- Use `langchain_community` for community integrations
- Prefer `langchain_openai` or `langchain_anthropic` for specific providers
- Include try/except blocks for external API calls
- Add logging for debugging and learning

## When Writing Blog Posts

- Start with context - what we're learning and why
- Show code examples with explanations
- Include expected outputs/results
- Provide troubleshooting tips
- Link to next steps in learning path
- Reference relevant LangChain documentation

## Additional Notes

- This is a public Linode GitHub repo - code quality matters
- Focus on clarity and education over cleverness
- Test on actual Linode GPU instances when possible
- Consider both beginners and intermediate developers
- Keep examples minimal but complete
